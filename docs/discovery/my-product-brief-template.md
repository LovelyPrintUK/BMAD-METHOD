**💡 Tips for Filling This Out:**

1. **Don't overthink it** - Bullet points and rough notes are fine
2. **Be specific** - "Busy professionals" → "Sales reps who spend 2hrs/day on data entry"
3. **Focus on the problem first** - Really understand the pain before jumping to solutions
4. **Challenge every feature** - "Do I REALLY need this for v1?"
5. **Mark uncertainties** - It's OK to not know everything; mark assumptions
6. **Keep it real** - Write for yourself, not for investors (unless you are pitching to investors!)

**⏰ Time Guide:**
- Quick pass: 30 minutes
- Thorough pass: 1-2 hours
- Don't spend more than 1 day on this!
