# 🚀 Discovery Phase (Phase 1) - Beginner's Guide

**Welcome!** This guide will help you understand the Discovery process and get started with your first project using BMAD-METHOD.

---

## What is the Discovery Phase?

Discovery Phase (Phase 1) is like having a conversation with yourself about your project idea **before** you start building. It helps you:

- **Clarify your idea** - Turn vague thoughts into concrete plans
- **Understand the problem** - What are you really trying to solve?
- **Define your users** - Who will use this and why?
- **Scope your MVP** - What features do you actually need for the first version?

**Important:** Discovery is **100% OPTIONAL**. If you already know what you want to build, you can skip straight to Phase 2 (Planning).

---

## When Should You Use Discovery?

### ✅ Use Discovery When:

- You have a project idea but it's still fuzzy
- You're not sure what features to include
- You want to explore different approaches
- You need to convince others (stakeholders, partners)
- You want to validate your idea makes sense

### ⏭️ Skip Discovery When:

- Your requirements are crystal clear
- You're fixing bugs or adding simple features
- You're following an existing pattern
- You need to start building immediately

## The 5 Discovery Workflows (Simplified)

Phase 1 has 5 specialized workflows. Here's what each one does in plain English:

### 1. **Product Brief** ⭐ **START HERE**

**What it is:** A guided conversation that helps you capture your product vision

**Best for:** Almost everyone, especially beginners

**What you'll create:**

- Problem statement (what pain are you solving?)
- Solution overview (how will you solve it?)
- Target users (who is this for?)
- MVP features (what goes in version 1?)
- Success metrics (how will you know it works?)

**Time:** 30-60 minutes

**Simple explanation:** Think of it as writing a "pitch document" for your idea - but the AI helps you figure out what to say by asking smart questions.

---

### 2. **Brainstorm Project**

**What it is:** Explore multiple ways to solve your problem

**Best for:** When you're not sure which technical approach to use

**What you'll create:**

- Multiple solution options
- Pros/cons of each approach
- Risk analysis
- Recommended path forward

**Simple explanation:** Like having 3 different architects give you 3 different designs for your house, then helping you pick the best one.

---

### 3. **Research**

**What it is:** Deep-dive into market, competitors, or technical options

**Research types available:**

- **Market** - Is there a business opportunity?
- **Competitive** - What else exists? How is yours different?
- **Technical** - Which framework/technology should I use?
- **User** - Who are my customers and what do they need?

**Best for:** When you need data to make decisions

**Simple explanation:** Like hiring a research assistant to gather information about competitors, market size, or technology options.

---

### 4. **Domain Research**

**What it is:** Industry-specific deep dives

**Best for:** Understanding specific industries (healthcare, fintech, gaming, etc.)

**Simple explanation:** Learning the rules and trends of a specific field before you build something in it.

---

### 5. **Brainstorm Game**

**What it is:** Game concept generation using creative techniques

**Best for:** Game developers exploring ideas

**Simple explanation:** Like a game design jam session with an AI that knows creative ideation methods.

---

## 🎯 What Should I Do FIRST?

Here's your step-by-step path as a beginner:

### Option 1: Guided Discovery (Recommended)

1. **Run the Product Brief workflow** (the AI walks you through everything)
2. **Then move to Phase 2** (create your PRD - Product Requirements Document)

### Option 2: Manual Discovery (You're reading this!)

1. **Read this guide** (you're doing it!)
2. **Answer the key questions below** yourself
3. **Document your answers** in a simple file
4. **Move to Phase 2** when you're ready

## 📝 Key Questions to Answer During Discovery

If you want to think through Discovery on your own, answer these questions:

### About Your Project

- **Project name:** What are you calling this?
- **The big idea:** What are you building in one sentence?
- **Why this matters:** What got you excited about this idea?

### About the Problem

- **What problem are you solving?** (be specific!)
- **Who has this problem?** (describe real people)
- **How are they handling it today?** (what's their current workaround?)
- **What's the cost of NOT solving it?** (time wasted, money lost, frustration)

### About Your Solution

- **How will you solve it?** (high-level approach)
- **What makes your solution different?** (why not use existing tools?)
- **What's the "magic moment"?** (when will users say "wow, this is awesome!")

### About Your Users

- **Who is your primary user?** (be specific: not "everyone", but "freelance designers who...")
- **What do they care about most?** (speed? cost? ease of use?)
- **How tech-savvy are they?** (affects your design)

### About Your MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- **Core features:** What MUST be in version 1?
- **Nice-to-haves:** What can wait until version 2?
- **Out of scope:** What are you definitely NOT building (yet)?

### About Success

- **How will you know this works?** (5 users? 100? $1000 revenue?)
- **What would make you proud?** (personal projects)
- **What metrics matter?** (business projects)

## 📁 Where to Save Your Discovery Work

Create a folder in your project:

```
your-project/
  docs/
    discovery/
      product-brief.md          ← Your main vision document
      market-research.md        ← If you did research
      brainstorming-notes.md    ← If you brainstormed
```

**Tip:** These documents will be used in Phase 2 when you create your PRD!

## 🎬 Getting Started - Your First Steps

### Step 1: Decide Your Approach

Choose one:

**A) Use the AI-guided Product Brief workflow**

- Load the Analyst agent in your IDE
- Run the `*product-brief` workflow
- Follow the conversation

**B) Do it manually**

- Create a file: `docs/discovery/product-brief.md`
- Answer the key questions above
- Write it in your own words (no template needed!)

### Step 2: Spend 30-60 Minutes Thinking

Don't rush! Good discovery = better product.

### Step 3: When Done, Move to Phase 2

Phase 2 is where you create detailed requirements (PRD or tech-spec).

---

## 💡 Beginner Tips

### ✅ DO:

- Keep it simple - bullet points are fine
- Focus on the problem, not the solution (at first)
- Be specific about users ("busy parents" → "parents with kids under 5 who work full-time")
- Challenge yourself: "Do I REALLY need that feature for v1?"

### ❌ DON'T:

- Spend more than 1-2 days on Discovery (it's exploration, not a thesis)
- Try to answer everything perfectly (some uncertainty is OK)
- Add every feature you can think of (ruthlessly prioritize)
- Skip defining WHO this is for (affects everything else)

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to do Discovery?**
A: Nope! It's optional. If you're clear on what to build, skip to Phase 2.

**Q: Can I come back and update my Discovery docs later?**
A: Yes! They're living documents. Update as you learn.

**Q: What if I don't know my market size or competitors?**
A: That's OK for hobby projects. For business projects, run the Research workflow.

**Q: How detailed should my Product Brief be?**
A: Hobby project: 2-3 pages. Startup: 5-7 pages. Enterprise: 10+ pages. Match it to your needs.

**Q: I'm stuck on a question. What do I do?**
A: Make your best guess and mark it as an assumption. You can validate later.

## Next Steps After Discovery

Once you've completed Discovery (or decided to skip it):

1. **Phase 2: Planning** - Create your PRD (Product Requirements Document) or tech-spec
2. **Phase 3: Architecture** - Design your system (for larger projects)
3. **Phase 4: Implementation** - Actually build it!

See `/src/modules/bmm/docs/quick-start.md` for the complete workflow.

## Example: Simple Product Brief

Here's what a minimal Product Brief looks like:

```markdown
# Product Brief: Task Timer App

## The Problem

Freelancers lose track of time working on client projects and either
undercharge or can't prove their hours.

## The Solution

A simple desktop timer that tracks time per project with one-click start/stop.
Auto-generates invoices with time logs.

## Target Users

Freelance designers and developers billing hourly ($50-150/hr range)

## MVP Features

- One-click timer start/stop
- Project tagging
- Basic time log export (CSV)
- Simple invoice template

## Out of Scope (for now)

- Mobile app
- Team features
- Integrations with accounting software
- Automated invoicing

## Success Metric

If 10 freelancers use it weekly for 3 months, it's working.
```

**That's it!** Simple, clear, actionable.

## Ready to Start?

Pick your path:

🤖 **AI-Guided:** Load the Analyst agent → run `*product-brief` workflow

✍️ **Manual:** Create `docs/discovery/product-brief.md` → answer the key questions

🏃 **Skip Discovery:** Go straight to Phase 2 PRD workflow

---

**Remember:** Discovery is about clarity, not perfection. Spend enough time to get clear, then move forward. You can always come back and refine!

Good luck! 🚀
